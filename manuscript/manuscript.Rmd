The proportions of participants with missing covariate information were comparable to those presented in the anti-hypertensives paper.

* Full covariate information was available for `r totaltext`.
* IMD 2010 score, a proxy for socioeconomic position that is measured as twentiles with 1 indicating the least deprived and 20 indicating the most deprived, was missing for `r imdtext`.
*  Alcohol status was missing for `r alcoholtext`. 
*  Smoking status was missing for `r smokingtext`.
* BMI, or a calculated BMI from height and weight measurements, was missing for `r bmitext`.

&nbsp;

Table \@ref(tab:cohort2table1) shows the proportion of participants receviving each drug class who subsequently stoppped (greater than 6 months between last prescription and end of data), added (second drug prescribed before last prescription for the index_drug) or switched (second drug prescribed after last prescription for the index_drug).

&nbsp;

Note: the discrepancies between the number of participants in the table of characteristics and that displayed in the forest plot is due to `r prior.all` participants having a diagnosis date prior to the index date (`r prior.none` in the control group and `r prior.statins` in the statin group).

The summary results of the Cox proportional hazards models with time varying treatment and adjustment for baseline covariates for any dementia outcome. 

Overall, the analysis indicated that treatment with any lipid-regulating agent was associated with an increased HR of dementia, consisent across all dementia sub-types.  



In terms of baseline confounders, the largest attenuation was seen on adjustment for age.

```{r}

cohort2results1 <- cohort2results[which(cohort2results$outcome=="Any dementia"&cohort2results$drug=="Any"&cohort2results$analysis!="6-month cutoff"&cohort2results$analysis!="Time-varying"),]

cohort2results1 <- cohort2results1[order(cohort2results1$covariates),]

cohort2results1 <- cohort2results1[,c(3:9)]


knitr::kable(cohort2results1, booktabs = TRUE, caption = 'Cohort 2 - Results from Cox proportional hazards regression of any dementia diagnosis on treatment with any lipid-regulating agent vs no treatment', row.names = FALSE, col.names = c("Analysis","Covariates","HR","Std Error", "P-value", "Upper 95%CI","Upper 95%CI"))

```


&nbsp;

For the analyses above, the following baseline covariates were adjusted for: sex, age, charlson, Index multiple deprivation, consultation rate, alcohol (ever), smoking (ever), BMI, cardiovascular disease, coronary bypass surgery, coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, and hypertension. In analyses with time-varying covariates, a participants' cardiovascular disease, coronary bypass surgery, coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, and hypertension status was allowed to vary over time.
